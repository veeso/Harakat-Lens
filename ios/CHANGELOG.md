## 0.3.1

Released on 06/05/2026

- Modernized the SwiftUI codebase to iOS 17+ patterns:
  - Migrated state from `ObservableObject` / `@Published` / `@StateObject` to `@Observable` + `@State` + `@Environment`.
  - Replaced `NavigationView` with `NavigationStack` and switched the tab bar to the iOS 17 `Tab` API with an enum-typed selection.
  - Replaced `MagnificationGesture`, `foregroundColor`, `cornerRadius` and `UIImpactFeedbackGenerator` with `MagnifyGesture`, `foregroundStyle`, `clipShape(.rect(...))` and `sensoryFeedback`.
  - Replaced Combine `debounce` and `DispatchQueue.asyncAfter` with cancellable `Task` + `Task.sleep`.
- Camera view polish:
  - Split into dedicated `CameraPermissionView`, `CameraLiveView`, `RecognizedTextOverlay` and `CopyToast` views.
  - Added a `ContentUnavailableView`-based permission screen with a deep link into Settings.
- Text view polish:
  - Replaced the read-only `TextEditor` with a `Text`-based `ReadOnlyTextBox` and switched the Hanzi input to `TextField(axis: .vertical)`.
- Added a shared `AppDesign` enum with spacing, corner radii, animation durations and tap target constants used across views.
- Fixed OCR overlays on gallery and captured photos rendering at the wrong size and position by mapping Vision's normalized box onto the displayed image's aspect-fit rect and passing the image orientation to the Vision request.

## 0.3.0

Released on 02/05/2026

- [Issue 13](https://github.com/veeso/BiangBiang-Hanzi/issues/13): Camera controls. Pinch-to-zoom and 1x/2x/5x preset buttons in the camera view, with automatic lens switching on devices with multiple back cameras (triple/dual).

## 0.2.0

Released on 03/01/2026

- [Issue 10](https://github.com/veeso/BiangBiang-Hanzi/issues/10): Do not strip non hanzi characters from sentence that contains hanzi. For instance `我在NASA工作. 现在是5点.` caused converted text to be just `wǒ zài gōng zuò. xiàn zài shì diǎn.` instead of `wǒ zài NASA gōng zuò. xiàn zài shì 5 diǎn.`.
- [Issue 9](https://github.com/veeso/BiangBiang-Hanzi/issues/9): Added tab to file issues from within the app.

## 0.1.3

Released on 16/11/2025

- [Issue 2](https://github.com/veeso/BiangBiang-Hanzi/issues/2): Fixed camera not auto-focusing when moving closer to text.
- [Issue 4](https://github.com/veeso/BiangBiang-Hanzi/issues/4): Better feedback for copying text to clipboard from text overlays.
